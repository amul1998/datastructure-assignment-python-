        "Q1.HF What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:1.1. Interpreted Languages\n",
        "\n",
        "Execution Process:\n",
        "    The code is executed line by line by an interpreter during runtime.\n",
        "    No separate compilation step is required before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "    Ease of Debugging: Errors are shown immediately at the point of failure since the code runs line by line.\n",
        "    Flexibility: Easier to experiment with and modify code quickly.\n",
        "    Portability: Can run on any platform with the appropriate interpreter installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "    Slower Execution: Line-by-line execution can be less efficient compared to precompiled code.\n",
        "    Dependency: Requires the presence of an interpreter on the target system.\n",
        "Compiled Languages\n",
        "\n",
        "Execution Process:\n",
        "\n",
        " The code is translated into machine code (binary) by a compiler before execution.\n",
        " The compiled binary is then executed by the system.\n",
        "Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        " Speed: Precompiled machine code is optimized for execution, making it faster than interpretation.\n",
        " Self-Containment: Compiled binaries do not require an external interpreter, making them more portable as standalone executables.\n",
        " Optimization: Compilers often optimize the code, improving performance.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",
        " Longer Development Cycle: Changes require recompilation before testing.\n",
        " Platform Dependency: The compiled binary is often specific to the architecture it was compiled for (e.g., Windows, Linux).\n",
        "Q2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to gracefully handle errors or unexpected events during its execution, rather than crashing. It ensures that even when an error occurs, the program can take appropriate action or terminate cleanly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to ensure that a specific block of code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This makes it particularly useful for performing cleanup actions or resource management, such as closing files, releasing locks, or disconnecting from a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Logging in Python is a mechanism for tracking events that happen while the program runs. The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It is used for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of an application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Significance of the del Method\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleanup Operations:\n",
        "    The __del__ method allows you to define actions that should happen when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "    Example: Closing open files, releasing network connections, or deallocating resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Triggered by Garbage Collection:\n",
        "    Python uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory.\n",
        "    The __del__ method is invoked when the reference count of an object drops to zero, meaning no part of the program is using the object anymore.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not Guaranteed to Run:\n",
        "    The exact timing of the __del__ method call is unpredictable because it depends on the garbage collector.\n",
        "    In certain cases (e.g., circular references), the method might not be called at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoid Using __del__ Excessively:\n",
        "    It can make the program harder to debug if not used carefully.\n",
        "    Explicit resource management (e.g., with statement) is usually a better approach.\n",
        "Q6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.import Imports the entire module. from ... import imports specific components only.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.import Access via module_name.component from ... import Access directly via component.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.import Less likely (module acts as prefix). from ... import More likely (direct component access).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.import Slightly more memory usage (entire module loaded). from ... import Potentially more efficient for selective imports.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex import:import math Ex for from ... import:from math import sqrt\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions in a few different ways, depending on the structure and the nature of the exceptions. The try...except block is used to catch and handle exceptions, and you can handle multiple exceptions either by using multiple except clauses, grouping exceptions in a single except clause, or using a generic except clause to catch all exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The with statement in Python is used for resource management and is commonly employed when handling files. Its main purpose is to simplify the process of opening, using, and closing resources such as files, network connections, or database connections, while ensuring that the resource is properly cleaned up after use, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9: What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:1. Multithreading\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Multithreading involves running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process. Each thread shares the same memory space but can execute independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency: Threads within a process run concurrently. They can be thought of as tasks that run in parallel but share the same resources, such as memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shared Memory: All threads share the same memory space, so data sharing between threads is easier. However, this shared memory also requires synchronization (e.g., using locks) to prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space. Each process runs independently and has its own Python interpreter and GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency: Processes run concurrently, and each process can truly execute in parallel on multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separate Memory: Each process has its own memory space, meaning there is no shared memory by default. This prevents issues like race conditions and memory corruption but requires inter-process communication (IPC) methods (such as queues, pipes, or shared memory) to share data between processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Using logging in a program provides several important advantages that enhance the quality, maintainability, and troubleshootability of your code. Unlike simple print statements, the logging module offers a more robust and flexible way to track events during the execution of your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the key advantages of using logging in a program: 1.Better Control Over Output 2.Persistent Log Data 3.Improved Debugging and Troubleshooting 4.Better Error Handling 5.Non-Intrusive 6.Flexibility 7.Integration with External Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11.F What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently allocating, using, and deallocating memory during the execution of a program. Python provides built-in mechanisms to handle memory management automatically, which helps developers avoid many of the complexities of manual memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:try: Attempt to execute code that might throw an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "except: If an exception occurs, handle it here (you can specify the exception type).\n",
        "\n",
        "else: (Optional) Code that runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "finally: (Optional) Code that will run regardless of an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management in Python is crucial because it ensures efficient use of resources, helps prevent memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures the stability of the application. Although Python handles much of the memory management automatically through reference counting and garbage collection, a good understanding of how memory is managed can lead to more efficient, scalable, and optimized programs. By being mindful of how Python handles memory and using the right techniques and tools, you can write better and more efficient code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, try and except are key components of exception handling, which allows you to handle errors and exceptional conditions in your program without crashing it. They are used to manage runtime errors in a controlled way, providing a mechanism to respond to unexpected situations\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically managing memory by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, ensuring that unused objects are removed to free up space for new ones. This helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes memory usage in a Python program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block in Python's exception handling system is used to define a section of code that should execute only if no exception was raised in the associated try block. It provides a way to execute code that depends on the success of the code inside the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from applications and libraries. This helps in tracking the flow of execution, debugging, and monitoring the application. The logging module supports various logging levels that indicate the severity or importance of the log messages.\n",

        "Q18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork() is a lower-level, Unix-specific system call used to create child processes by duplicating the parent process. It is less commonly used in Python due to platform limitations and complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "multiprocessing is a higher-level, cross-platform module designed to create and manage processes. It simplifies parallelism, supports inter-process communication, and is recommended for most parallel computing tasks in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing a file is important to ensure the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper release of system resources (file descriptors).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensuring that all data is written to the file, preventing data loss or corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Allowing other processes or users to access the file.\n",
